# Intro

### This is the prototype for actuating a stepper motor using EMG signals, with the final purpose of studying prosthetic devices. 

### Current model was developed for string based actuation like the e-NABLE hand found at https://enablingthefuture.org/ and still is a work in progress.

### The project started in 2018, and after my graduation it took a big hiatus. Updates are due, and I'm getting back to work with this concept in early 2022.

### Feel free to ask questions and colab in this development.
